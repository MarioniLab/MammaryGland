# Scripts used for the Analysis for the Bach et al. paper 
This repository contains all files that are necessary to reproduce the results from the paper.
The repository is structured as follows:
- All scripts are contained in the [src](src/) folder
- Apart from general analyses (e.g. QC, clustering) the scripts are organized according to the figures in the study
- Some scripts produce intermeditate results that are stored in the [data](data/) folder
